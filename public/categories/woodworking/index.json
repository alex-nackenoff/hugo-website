Self-Verification","uri":"https://www.alexnackenoff.com/posts/encrypted-e-mail-public-key/"},{"content":"  The Inspiration At some point in the wedding planning process, it had crossed my mind to brew some beer for the reception, though I was not going to make that a non-negotiable factor for choosing a venue that would allow 1) outside alcohol and 2) homebrewed beer. The number of venues in Nashville that permitted homebrew were small, and we had more pressing demands (like trying to fit 200 people in a venue).\nBy some luck, we settled upon a venue that permitted both outside alcohol and homebrewed beer. So now I guess I had to brew some beer for my wedding as the stars had aligned. Additionally, it would look weird if I didn\u0026rsquo;t, considering I had brewed beer for 2 friends\u0026rsquo; weddings at this point. After a few back of the napkin calculations, I started considering whether I could brew all the beer for the wedding, and once I realized it was feasible, I naturally used that as evidence that I should.\nSo I was on my way to brewing, and realized I needed a good way to serve it. The only restrictions from the venue was we could not self-serve, so the options had to be simple enough for their bartenders to operate.\nMy Options:  Bottle my beer  Bottling 150 beers for my friend\u0026rsquo;s wedding was hard enough, and I needed more like 750 for mine. Difficult to naturally carbonate (with yeast) to yield crystal clear pours Could carbonate in kegs then bottle, but this would be a ton of work Would need to buy/collect a ton of bottles   Find someone with a big enough prebuilt chest freezer/ice-chest  Highly unlikely   Rent a jockey-box  Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know if I were renting a plate or coil chilled jockey box until I had it To be safe, I would really need to build an ice-chest regardless to minimize foaming (disaster at a wedding), which minimizes the cost-saving of renting   Buy a jockey-box  This way I could ensure I had a more efficient coil chilled jockey box Still a risk of foaming with room temperature kegs of beer I still felt that cooling the kegs in an ice chest was essential to prevent foaming   Build an ice chest  $$$ Time    As you can see, I had already talked myself into building an ice chest by this point. Foaming beer was not an option at a wedding, especially if I was going to spend a lot of time and effort brewing a bunch of good beer.\nFoam Inner Box aka the easy part First time using a caulk gun Plywood Shell Wheels Exoskeleton, tied into the wheel base Inner shower pan liner going in Corny Keg for scale Exterior Shell So glad I bought a pocket hole jig Floating Frame The sides are connected to the front with piano hinges to aid in storage and transportation\nHooks in with Picture Tongue Hooks Birch Plywood Exterior aka Really Wish I Had a Pickup Truck\nStarting on the Bar Top Here you can see how my pocket hole jig made this project possible\nTop framing done, nesting on top of the hinged side panels This is upside down to get the bottom edge trim in the right place Placing the vertical trim All in place Front view of the shell that fits on the ice chest Tap Arrangement Cutting the hole for the drip tray and hose lines Lacquer Finishing (2 Days Before the Wedding) Transportation Did I ever turn the drain port to the closed position before the wedding? No..... In Action I was too rushed to take pictures of the setup process (needed to be on time for my own wedding), but it fit 15 corny kegs. I brewed 4 recipes, daisy-chaining the kegs together that were the same recipe (liquid out port-\u0026gt;gas-in port). I somehow guessed correctly on the CO2 serving pressure, helping cap off a perfect day.\nThanks for reading, and comment if you have any questions!\n","description":"Gallery depicting my rushed wedding beer cart construction","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Wedding Beer Cart","uri":"https://www.alexnackenoff.com/posts/wedding-beer-cart/"},{"content":"Finished Product First   Not Pictured: A Lot of Sawdust Covering My New Apartment\n  Piling Up Everything After a Ton of Planning I went with walnut, as it is relatively cheap in Tennessee. But this was definitely the no-turning-back moment.\nShowing up to the lumber yard in my sedan was probably hilarious to the owner, but the wood fit (I think these were 8ft S2S)\n S2S = Surfaced on 2 Sides. In reality this was S3S, as there was a straight cut ripped edge. All lumber from Lowes/Home Depot is going to be S4S. For a more detailed explanation from a professional, click here\n Table Frame Pipe projects were all the rage at this point (Summer 2016), but I was going to put a bit more thought into my project. In reality it was easy and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a good plan for making legs/frame in an apartment \u0026ldquo;woodworking\u0026rdquo; setup\n  Left: the design I went with. Right: the design I secretly wanted to do, but pipe fittings are expensive. Also give everyone the opportunity for proper after dinner leg crossing\n  This was surprisingly expensive. Probably Lowes/Home Depot\u0026rsquo;s way of cashing in on the pipe crafting trend\nHere you can get a sense of the design I was going for. I took some time to improve on the designs I had seen as to maximize the distance between the bottom edge of the table and someone's thighs as well as making all 4 sides usable. This X-shape gives everyone room for knees and thighs. And yes I did a few simulations in Adobe Illustrator As well as being a necessary connector, these also gave me some wiggle room to level out the table. Since I didn't have a large planer to ensure that, I gave myself a few places where I could level things out. Mockup of the final table dimensions to ensure I was in the right ballpark. Also I needed a work surface to cut the wood later. Kitchen Cart I kept having to go back and ensure everything was parallel \u0026 screwed in the same. If they weren't, nothing would come together in later steps It might be obvious to some, but at first I designed an impossible structure. There was no way to get everything to screw together if not for the union couplings The union couplings allowed me to build 2 identical top \u0026 bottom pieces of the frame and actually get it together. It did take me a few days to figure out these existed. Luckily I caught my impossible design in the planning stage and not after buying pipe This was the main inspiration for this entire project: a way for me to hang my pans I couldn't find any S-hooks that were designed the way I needed them to be, or be large enough to fit into the holes in my pan handles, so I got these and figured I would try bending them 90 degrees With 2 wrenches, this wasn't that difficult. I think they were even stainless steel Here is a way I could adapt my casters to fit in the cavity of the pipe fittings while staying somewhat upright. I did have to replace the wood about a year or 2 later. I was so happy at this point, but I was slightly dreading that I had finally come to the point where I had to cut the wood Cutting the Wood Yeah, a circular saw is all I could manage on a tight budget. That blue jig in the top right would serve as the rip fence for the rip cuts a few pictures down. I'm sure I committed some woodworking crime but it worked. Also thankfully, I lived between 2 hard of hearing elderly neighbors (or they were very nice and lied that they couldn't hear anything) I made some random chop cuts first so I had some experience with the saw before making the rip cuts, as well as making the rips a bit more manageable. Yes this was the first time I had ever used a powered saw let alone a circular saw. Circular saws still scare me to this day Probably a lot of time passed between the previous picture and this one. I planned a bunch and psyched myself up to make the cuts. I actually had the foresight to go with an edge-grain style butcher block style table. The main reason is that I knew the circular saw was not going to be very accurate with respect to the angle of the blade, which would make glue-up impossible if trying to glue 2 cuts together (which would be necessary in end-grain or face-grain cutting board aesthetics). By doing edge-grain, those inaccuracies wouldn't be glued to anything (here: facing up) and could be planed/sanded down. After a lot of cutting to make the pieces random in length. I used the foam as a sacrificial cutting surface to minimize tear-out of the wood Here you can see the idea coming together a bit better Well, this is what I get for using a circular saw. Inaccurate cuts means more time sanding the end grain and using wood filler Progress. I can work with these smaller gaps Failed clamping attempt. It's hammered-down knowledge to clamp from above and below a surface for symmetric clamping, but it was obvious here that I needed a flat surface to do my glue ups. I had to laugh as I had taken a lot of time planning what pieces looked best where. Oh well, laugh while you can Glue-Up Kitchen Cart Glue-Up Doing the glue-up on the kitchen cart first so I had some practice on a smaller piece before doing the table glue-up\nFlipping the pieces for the glue-up Went very quickly and glued as fast as I could, but happy with the clamping at the end. Removed the piece to make everything flush on the left edge, cleaned up as much excess glue as I could, and left it clamped overnight Eek I stupidly took the time to make and apply wood filler, which was all going to come off after planing/sanding, so don't do that until after you've planed Cut off the excess overhang. I probably should have trimmed the pieces individually most of the way so they would be more usable, but I managed to use all the off cuts for other cutting board projects later Leaving this for now until I have my table glued up Table Glue-Up Marking off how much more wood I needed to make my table 36\" square After a lot of rearranging, I ran out of excuses and went for the glue up In retrospect, I should have done this glue-up in 2-4 separate sections. Gluing a 1ft width section at least until the glue was tacky would have given me a much better glue-up and a ton less stress. You can see the hammer I had to use to bang the pieces together to minimize gaps. Don't do what I did if you recreate this project Sanding, Wood Fill, Planing, and More Sanding To make wood filler, you take sawdust from sanding and mix it with glue, then smear it into any gaps. Again, I did this first one too early in the process, but at least I had practice Here you can really see the issues with using a circular saw for the rip cuts. This all needs to be sanded down. At this point, my parents pitied me knowing how much sanding this would take and bought me a hand-held planer. Thanks Mom and Dad! I started off timidly, but learned to love this little planer Much better already Resting in its final location, waiting for final sanding and attaching it to the frame Now is the actual time for wood filler After much sanding Finishing Steps Not shown is where I flipped everything upside down and attached the frame to the underside of the wooden surface with some wood screws through the holes in the pipe flanges At the same time, I was also brewing and bottling the beer for a friend's wedding, so my apartment was a mess Mineral Oil Coat I had to remember to take a picture; the first coat of mineral oil was magical. Walnut looks good regardless, but now it really shined Now I know why I saved the best dark wood for the table Here it is finished.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the recipe I used for this batch:\nRecipe Gluten-Free GF with egg whites GF with sourdough starter All-Purpose/Wheat Recipe  Gluten Free Base Recipe    Flour Amount (grams)     Gluten Free Flour Mix 338   Fine Corn Meal 127   Potato Starch 85   Salt 9   Sugar 25   Olive Oil 55   Water 482   Yeast* 5      Gluten Free w/ Egg Whites    Flour Amount (grams)     Gluten Free Flour Mix 338   Fine Corn Meal 127   Potato Starch 85   Salt 9   Sugar 25   Olive Oil 55   Water 425   Egg Whites 57.5   Yeast* 5      Gluten Free w/ Sourdough Starter    Flour Amount (grams)     Gluten Free Flour Mix 238   Fine Corn Meal 127   Potato Starch 85   Salt 9   Sugar 25   Olive Oil 55   Water 232   Sourdough Starter* 350     *My GF sourdough starter is 100g flour and 250g water, with carryover yeast. If you have less, or your ratios are different, see below on how to adjust your water \u0026 flour additions for the recipe  All-Purpose/Wheat Flour Recipe    Flour Amount     All-Purpose Flour 2.5 cups   Salt 2 tsp   Sugar 1 tsp   Olive Oil 1 Tbsp   Corn Oil* 0.25 cup   Water 0.75 cup   Yeast 5g     *Feel free to substitute with vegetable/olive/canola oil    'use strict'; var containerId = JSON.parse(\"\\\"44a34ca57b09eb05\\\"\"); var containerElem = document.getElementById(containerId); var tabLinks = null; var tabContents = null; var ids = []; if (containerElem) { tabLinks = containerElem.querySelectorAll('.tab__link'); tabContents = containerElem.querySelectorAll('.tab__content'); } for (var i = 0; i 0) { tabContents[0].style.display = 'block'; }  Makes 1 sheet pan pizza\n*If you want to use sourdough starter instead, skip the yeast and look below here\nIf you can consume gluten, use all-purpose or bread flour instead of the gluten-free flour mix and potato starch. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend using the corn meal because that\u0026rsquo;s traditional and it tastes good. Additionally, I have used coarse corn meal and it has worked great, just a different texture. If you desire a bit more soft chew, use some egg whites (2 or 50 grams) in place of some of the water weight.\nUsing Sourdough Starter In this recipe I used a gluten free \u0026ldquo;sourdough\u0026rdquo; starter, which requires a few modifications to the recipe. What I\u0026rsquo;m actually doing is what\u0026rsquo;s referred to as a perpetual dough, where you hold back a golf ball sized amount of risen dough [from a bread loaf recipe]. Important note, you cannot do this method if you use eggs in your recipe (you can however use your perpetual dough as a starter, ie. not contaminating your starter mix with egg whites in your recipe). To that held back bit of dough, I add 250g of water and 100g of GF flour, and mix thoroughly with a whisk. I usually leave it out at room temp for a few hours, then put in my fridge until I\u0026rsquo;m ready to bake again. I tried a more traditional 1:1 ratio, but my GF flour mix as xanthan gum in it which seemed to gel everything up and prevent yeast propagation; if you\u0026rsquo;re using wheat flour, 1:1 should be fine. So I\u0026rsquo;m not necessarily using a full sourdough starter, as I started off with dry instant yeast, but I\u0026rsquo;m getting more sourdough flavor the more I propagate and use it. And true to sourdough starters, it does rise much slower than dry instant yeast. I\u0026rsquo;ll make a full post about this at some point soon.\nIn short, add whatever mass of sourdough starter to the dough, replacing the appropriate amount of flour and water by weight. For example, I added 350g of sourdough starter, which is comprised of 28.6% of flour (100g) and 71.4% of water (250g) by weight, therefore add 100g less flour and 250g less water from the above recipe.\n  Use a stand mixer if you have it or a spatula or hand mixer if you don\u0026rsquo;t. It\u0026rsquo;s just not going to work with your hands. Gluten-Free flour doesn\u0026rsquo;t mix together well, forming dry pockets of flour like it\u0026rsquo;s its job\n  If using instant yeast, mix and let rise (covered) for 2 hours (slightly shorter if using wheat flour). If using a sourdough starter, let rise all day (\u0026gt;4 hours) or overnight in your fridge (or room temperature for more sourdough flavor)\nSheetpan Shaping is Superior to Hand Shaping Thin Crust Gluten-Free Pizza Another popular lie from gluten-free cooking blogs or books is that gluten-free dough is compatible with pizza peels \u0026amp; stones. Maybe it is if you use psyllium husk instead of xanthan gum, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried that yet, and I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like making a completely separate GF flour mix just for pizza. Just use a pan. It works just as well and is 100x easier to deal with, plus your oven isn\u0026rsquo;t going to get hot enough to replicate brick oven pizza anyway. If you have a brick oven in your backyard and are handy with a pizza peel, have at it. Also what are you doing here, and where do you live, so you can make me tasty fire baked pizzas all the time?\n  Use plenty of olive oil on your sheetpan. Also, bonus points for blending up your own tomatoes and reducing them to a loose paste consistency\n   For shaping, I like to keep a bowl of cool water nearby to dunk my hands in often. This dough is sticky. If you get too much in one area and need some in another, just pinch some off and add it to the area that needs it. This is a great advantage that Gluten-Free doughs have over traditional gluten doughs  Baking   Throw on your toppings while your oven preheats. Here I\u0026rsquo;m going with mozzarella with homemade pickled red onions and pickled sweet peppers. Not shown is the massive amount of parmesan I grated on top before baking\n  Since focaccia is baked around 425F and pizza is baked around 500-550F (not including brick pizza ovens), I decided to split the difference and start at 450F. This probably could have been 475F, as I bumped it up to that in the last third of the bake anyway, but see what you like. Lower temps are going to give a softer crust.\n  Bake at 450F for 30 min. What I actually did: 450F for 20 min, raise to 475F for 10 min What you should probably do: 475F for 25 min   Results   Bake until it looks kind of like this \u0026ndash; cheese starting to brown but not burn, and the crust shrinks in from the edge of the pan\n    Could I have gotten a bit more color? Sure. But it tasted great so who cares. If you do care, brush the crust with egg wash or garlic butter before baking\n  I\u0026rsquo;ll update this post if someone sends me a good sheetpan style glutinous pizza dough recipe, but in a pinch, find a focaccia recipe, skip the salt water brine, add tomato sauce and toppings and bake and I\u0026rsquo;m positive you\u0026rsquo;ll make something really good.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s my take on a sheet pan gluten free pizza! It\u0026rsquo;s our new preferred way to make gluten-free pizza, as it gets the crust thin enough without too much work. I will make a deep dish gluten free pizza work, but no attempt has come close to how good and easy this sheetpan method is.\nComment down below or use any of my contact links to ask questions!

No But you can get close. After a few too many failed attempts at baking gluten-free for my girlfriend (now wife) using random Google search result cooking blogs, I sought out the best reputable source as I knew this was possible. I came across and got a well cited and reviewed gluten free bread book on Amazon \u0026quot;Gluten-Free Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo; (which is a clickbait lie regarding 5 minutes but ignore that, it\u0026rsquo;s really good). Immediately reading the essential pages, I realized that the critical step in gluten-free bread baking comes down to the composition of the flour mix, which I had largely ignored or used whatever gluten-free flour mix in my grocery store. The quality of my gluten free breads improved 10x overnight.\nThe flour mix is mostly rice flour based, but calls for sorghum flour (hard to find so you can replace with oat flour), potato starch (not flour), tapioca flour, and xanthan gum. Flour mix detailed below. Get a kitchen scale, and use the metric system. I use this scale.\n   Flour Amount (grams)     Rice Flour 1020   Sorghum Flour 455   Potato Starch 225   Tapioca Flour 225   Xanthan Gum 40    For the recipe of the bread\u0026hellip;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get in trouble with the authors and provide exact numbers as they\u0026rsquo;re in the book (they have the flour mix posted on their website, so I feel comfortable posting it here), but it\u0026rsquo;s about an 85% hydration dough (by weight, total weight 925g), with ~1 Tbsp of sugar, a little bit less of kosher salt, and yeast (or around 50g of healthy sourdough starter). Once you\u0026rsquo;ve made one loaf getting the technique down, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend for the next loaf replacing the some of the water liquid weight with an egg or 20g of olive oil. I find those replacements improve the spongy chew that you traditionally lose in gluten-free baking.\nBaking Techniques The key here is using steam to cook the bread. On the easy side, you could use a lidded dutch oven or oven safe stock pot (taking off the lid ~2/3 of the way through the cook time).\nDutch Oven Method   Dutch Oven Method. 1 hour cooktime at 450F, taking the lid off after 35 minutes\n  Since this method requires hand forming, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend completely refrigerating the dough beforehand, which practically means doing the dough a day ahead of time. It will work right after the rise, but the dough won\u0026rsquo;t hold its height as well as a chilled dough.\n  Warm/fresh dough will still taste great, but it will come out a bit disc-like\n   Lay down enough parchment paper   Size depends on how deep your baking vessel is, as you\u0026rsquo;ll use the extra parchment paper to lower the dough into the hot dutch over/stock pot\n Sprinkle a hefty pinch (~1 Tbsp) of corn meal (fine or coarse) onto parchment paper in the shape \u0026amp; size of a small dinner plate Drop dough carefully on top of corn meal, preserving as much trapped air as possible Wet hands with water and smooth dough into a document   I keep a bowl of water on the counter and re-wet my hands often\n Sift a light layer of flour on top of dough   I use a fine mesh kitchen strainer\n Slash the top with a sharp wet non-serrated knife   60% of the time, this works every time. It\u0026rsquo;s not as effective as glutinous doughs, and slashing won\u0026rsquo;t prevent additional cracks, sorry.\n  It mostly works as you can see, but don\u0026rsquo;t bet your life on the outcome\n   Preheat oven to 450F with the dutch oven/stock pot inside the oven to warm   Use an oven thermometer as I\u0026rsquo;ve found most ovens are inaccurate. Mine is off by as much as 50F! (link is to the one I use)\n Let dough rest/rise in the time it takes your oven to preheat, at least 30 minutes if using fresh/room temperature dough and 1 hour if using cold dough Take dutch oven/stock pot out of the oven and grasping either end of your parchment paper, lift and lower the dough into the dutch oven, being careful not to burn yourself on the hot pot Cover with lid and place back in hot oven and bake for 55 min - 1 hour, removing the lid after 35 min.   If your bread is not browned after 55 minutes, let it continue to bake with the lid off until it is, most likely another 5-10 minutes.\n Bread Pan Method On the other easy side, you can just add some water to a pan in the oven and never worry about opening the oven.\n  Steam Method in a Loaf Pan\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;Okay, I cheated and used an egg wash.\n   1 hour cooktime at 425F with 1 cup of water on a baking tray  For Those with Non-Gluten Wheat Allergies: If you only have a non-gluten wheat allergy like my wife does, you have a few more options to get it even closer to a glutinous bread. The easiest would be to replace 5-10% of the gluten free flour mix with rye or barley flour, which contain some gluten. I tend to let my stand mixer go for a bit longer kneading the dough to develop gluten (in any minimal capacity).\nI have plans at some point to try isolating \u0026amp; concentrating rye/barley gluten and introducing that to the gluten free flour mix, like the process to make seitan (for an example of what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, see here). But that will have to wait for another day when I\u0026rsquo;m inspired for some kitchen mad science.\n","description":"Here are some basic tips that got me in the right direction baking great gluten-free bread, including the right flour mix and starter recipe.","id":4,"section":"posts","tags":["Gluten-Free","Wheat-Free","Recipes"],"title":"Gluten Free Bread","uri":"https://www.alexnackenoff.com/posts/gluten-free-bread/"},{"content":"Hello!
