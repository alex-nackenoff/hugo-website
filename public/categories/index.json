[{"content":"  Just Like Any Gluten-Free Dough, This One is Going to be Wet Attempting to simulate gluten/crumb isn\u0026rsquo;t as important here as it is with bread, but don\u0026rsquo;t assume any gluten-free flour mix will work. See here for a good homemade GF flour mix. Here\u0026rsquo;s the recipe I used for this batch:\nRecipe    Flour Amount (grams)     Gluten Free Flour Mix 338   Fine Corn Meal 127   Potato Starch 85   Salt 9   Sugar 25   Olive Oil 55   Water 482   Yeast* 5    Makes 1 sheet pan pizza\n*If you want to use sourdough starter instead, skip the yeast and look below here\nIf you can consume gluten, use all-purpose or bread flour instead of the gluten-free flour mix and potato starch. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend using the corn meal because that\u0026rsquo;s traditional and it tastes good. Additionally, I have used coarse corn meal and it has worked great, just a different texture. If you desire a bit more soft chew, use some egg whites (2 or 50 grams) in place of some of the water weight.\nUsing Sourdough Starter In this recipe I used a gluten free \u0026ldquo;sourdough\u0026rdquo; starter, which requires a few modifications to the recipe. What I\u0026rsquo;m actually doing is what\u0026rsquo;s referred to as a perpetual dough, where you hold back a golf ball sized amount of risen dough [from a bread loaf recipe]. Important note, you cannot do this method if you use eggs in your recipe. To that held back bit of dough, I add 250g of water and 100g of GF flour, and mix thoroughly with a whisk. I usually leave it out at room temp for a few hours, then put in my fridge until I\u0026rsquo;m ready to bake again. I tried a more traditional 1:1 ratio, but my GF flour mix as xanthan gum in it which seemed to gel everything up and prevent yeast propagation; if you\u0026rsquo;re using wheat flour, 1:1 should be fine. So I\u0026rsquo;m not necessarily using a full sourdough starter, as I started off with dry instant yeast, but I\u0026rsquo;m getting more sourdough flavor the more I propagate and use it. And true to sourdough starters, it does rise much slower than dry instant yeast. I\u0026rsquo;ll make a full post about this at some point soon.\nIn short, add whatever mass of sourdough starter to the dough, replacing the appropriate amount of flour and water by weight. For example, I added 350g of sourdough starter, which is comprised of 28.6% of flour (100g) and 71.4% of water (250g) by weight, therefore add 100g less flour and 250g less water from the above recipe.\n  Use a stand mixer if you have it or a spatula or hand mixer if you don\u0026rsquo;t. It\u0026rsquo;s just not going to work with your hands. Gluten-Free flour doesn\u0026rsquo;t mix together well, forming dry pockets of flour like it\u0026rsquo;s its job\n  If using instant yeast, mix and let rise (covered) for 2 hours (slightly shorter if using wheat flour). If using a sourdough starter, let rise all day (\u0026gt;4 hours) or overnight in your fridge (or room temperature for more sourdough flavor)\nSheetpan Shaping is Superior to Hand Shaping Thin Crust Gluten-Free Pizza Another popular lie from gluten-free cooking blogs or books is that gluten-free dough is compatible with pizza peels \u0026amp; stones. Maybe it is if you use psyllium husk instead of xanthan gum, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried that yet, and I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like making a completely separate GF flour mix just for pizza. Just use a pan. It works just as well and is 100x easier to deal with, plus your oven isn\u0026rsquo;t going to get hot enough to replicate brick oven pizza anyway. If you have a brick oven in your backyard and are handy with a pizza peel, have at it. Also what are you doing here, and where do you live, so you can make me tasty fire baked pizzas all the time?\n  Use plenty of olive oil on your sheetpan. Also, bonus points for blending up your own tomatoes and reducing them to a loose paste consistency\n  Baking   Throw on your toppings while your oven preheats. Here I\u0026rsquo;m going with mozzarella with homemade pickled red onions and pickled sweet peppers. Not shown is the massive amount of parmesan I grated on top before baking\n  Since focaccia is baked around 425F and pizza is baked around 500-550F (not including brick pizza ovens), I decided to split the difference and start at 450F. This probably could have been 475F, as I bumped it up to that in the last third of the bake anyway, but see what you like. Lower temps are going to give a softer crust.\n Bake at 450F for 30 min. What I actually did: 450F for 20 min, raise to 475F for 10 min What you should probably do: 475F for 25 min  Results   Bake until it looks kind of like this \u0026ndash; cheese starting to brown but not burn, and the crust shrinks in from the edge of the pan\n    Could I have gotten a bit more color? Sure. But it tasted great so who cares. If you do care, brush the crust with egg wash or garlic butter before baking\n  I\u0026rsquo;ll update this post if someone sends me a good sheetpan style glutinous pizza dough recipe, but in a pinch, find a focaccia recipe, skip the salt water brine, add tomato sauce and toppings and bake and I\u0026rsquo;m positive you\u0026rsquo;ll make something really good.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s my take on a sheet pan gluten free pizza! It\u0026rsquo;s our new preferred way to make gluten-free pizza, as it gets the crust thin enough without too much work. I will make a deep dish gluten free pizza work, but no attempt has come close to how good and easy this sheetpan method is.\nComment down below or use any of my contact links to ask questions!

No But you can get close. After a few too many failed attempts at baking gluten-free for my girlfriend (now wife) using random Google search result cooking blogs, I sought out the best reputable source as I knew this was possible. I came across and got a well cited and reviewed gluten free bread book on Amazon \u0026quot;Gluten-Free Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo; (which is a clickbait lie regarding 5 minutes but ignore that, it\u0026rsquo;s really good). Immediately reading the essential pages, I realized that the critical step in gluten-free bread baking comes down to the composition of the flour mix, which I had largely ignored or used whatever gluten-free flour mix in my grocery store. The quality of my gluten free breads improved 10x overnight.\nThe flour mix is mostly rice flour based, but calls for sorghum flour (hard to find so you can replace with oat flour), potato starch (not flour), tapioca flour, and xanthan gum. Flour mix detailed below. Get a kitchen scale, and use the metric system. I use this scale.\n   Flour Amount (grams)     Rice Flour 1020   Sorghum Flour 455   Potato Starch 225   Tapioca Flour 225   Xanthan Gum 40    For the recipe of the bread\u0026hellip;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get in trouble with the authors and provide exact numbers as they\u0026rsquo;re in the book (they have the flour mix posted on their website, so I feel comfortable posting it here), but it\u0026rsquo;s about an 85% hydration dough (by weight, total weight 925g), with ~1 Tbsp of sugar, a little bit less of kosher salt, and yeast (or around 50g of healthy sourdough starter). Once you\u0026rsquo;ve made one loaf getting the technique down, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend for the next loaf replacing the some of the water liquid weight with an egg or 20g of olive oil. I find those replacements improve the spongy chew that you traditionally lose in gluten-free baking.\nBaking Techniques The key here is using steam to cook the bread. On the easy side, you could use a lidded dutch oven or oven safe stock pot (taking off the lid ~2/3 of the way through the cook time).\nDutch Oven Method   Dutch Oven Method. 1 hour cooktime at 450F, taking the lid off after 35 minutes\n  Since this method requires hand forming, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend completely refrigerating the dough beforehand, which practically means doing the dough a day ahead of time. It will work right after the rise, but the dough won\u0026rsquo;t hold its height as well as a chilled dough.\n  Warm/fresh dough will still taste great, but it will come out a bit disc-like\n   Lay down enough parchment paper   Size depends on how deep your baking vessel is, as you\u0026rsquo;ll use the extra parchment paper to lower the dough into the hot dutch over/stock pot\n Sprinkle a hefty pinch (~1 Tbsp) of corn meal (fine or coarse) onto parchment paper in the shape \u0026amp; size of a small dinner plate Drop dough carefully on top of corn meal, preserving as much trapped air as possible Wet hands with water and smooth dough into a document   I keep a bowl of water on the counter and re-wet my hands often\n Sift a light layer of flour on top of dough   I use a fine mesh kitchen strainer\n Slash the top with a sharp wet non-serrated knife   60% of the time, this works every time. It\u0026rsquo;s not as effective as glutinous doughs, and slashing won\u0026rsquo;t prevent additional cracks, sorry.\n  It mostly works as you can see, but don\u0026rsquo;t bet your life on the outcome\n   Preheat oven to 450F with the dutch oven/stock pot inside the oven to warm   Use an oven thermometer as I\u0026rsquo;ve found most ovens are inaccurate. Mine is off by as much as 50F! (link is to the one I use)\n Let dough rest/rise in the time it takes your oven to preheat, at least 30 minutes if using fresh/room temperature dough and 1 hour if using cold dough Take dutch oven/stock pot out of the oven and grasping either end of your parchment paper, lift and lower the dough into the dutch oven, being careful not to burn yourself on the hot pot Cover with lid and place back in hot oven and bake for 55 min - 1 hour, removing the lid after 35 min.   If your bread is not browned after 55 minutes, let it continue to bake with the lid off until it is, most likely another 5-10 minutes.\n Bread Pan Method On the other easy side, you can just add some water to a pan in the oven and never worry about opening the oven.\n  Steam Method in a Loaf Pan\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;Okay, I cheated and used an egg wash.\n   1 hour cooktime at 425F with 1 cup of water on a baking tray  For Those with Non-Gluten Wheat Allergies: If you only have a non-gluten wheat allergy like my wife does, you have a few more options to get it even closer to a glutinous bread. The easiest would be to replace 5-10% of the gluten free flour mix with rye or barley flour, which contain some gluten. I tend to let my stand mixer go for a bit longer kneading the dough to develop gluten (in any minimal capacity).\nI have plans at some point to try isolating \u0026amp; concentrating rye/barley gluten and introducing that to the gluten free flour mix, like the process to make seitan (for an example of what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, see here). But that will have to wait for another day when I\u0026rsquo;m inspired for some kitchen mad science.\n","description":"Here are some basic tips that got me in the right direction baking great gluten-free bread, including the right flour mix and starter recipe.","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["Gluten-Free","Wheat-Free","Recipes"],"title":"Gluten Free Bread","uri":"https://alexnackenoff.com/posts/gluten-free-bread/"},{"content":"Hello!
