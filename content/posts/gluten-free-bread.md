## Can You Replicate Glutinous Bread Without Gluten?
### No
But you can get close. After a few too many failed attempts at baking gluten-free for my girlfriend (now wife) using random Google search result cooking blogs, I sought out the best reputable source as I knew this was possible. I came across and got a well cited and reviewed gluten free bread book on Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-Artisan-Bread-Five-Minutes/dp/1250018315/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=gluten+free+bread+baking&qid=1599948059&sr=8-1">"Gluten-Free Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day..."</a> (which is a clickbait lie regarding 5 minutes but ignore that, it's really good). Immediately reading the essential pages, I realized that the critical step in gluten-free bread baking comes down to the composition of the flour mix, which I had largely ignored or used whatever gluten-free flour mix in my grocery store. The quality of my gluten free breads improved 10x overnight.

The flour mix is mostly rice flour based, but calls for sorghum flour (hard to find so you can replace with oat flour), potato starch (<u>not flour</u>), tapioca flour, and xanthan gum. Flour mix detailed below. Get a kitchen scale, and use the metric system. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079D9B82W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this</a> scale.

Flour | Amount (grams)
--------|------
 Rice Flour | 1020
Sorghum Flour | 455
Potato Starch | 225
Tapioca Flour | 225
Xanthan Gum | 40

For the recipe of the bread...I don't want to get in trouble with the authors and provide exact numbers as they're in the book (they have the flour mix posted on their website, so I feel comfortable posting it here), but it's about an 85% hydration dough (by weight), with a bit of sugar, a little bit less of <u>kosher</u> salt, and yeast. Once you've made one loaf getting the technique down, I'd recommend for the next loaf replacing the some of the water liquid weight with an egg or 20g of olive oil. I find those replacements improve the spongy chew that you traditionally lose in gluten-free baking.

## Baking Techniques

The key here is using steam to cook the bread. On the easy side, you could use a lidded dutch oven or oven safe stock pot (taking off the lid ~2/3 of the way through the cook time).

On the other easy side, you can just add some water to a pan in the oven and never worry about opening the oven.

## For Those with Non-Gluten Wheat Allergies:
If you only have a non-gluten wheat allergy like my wife does, you have a few more options to get it even closer to a glutinous bread. The easiest would be to replace 5-10% of the gluten free flour mix with rye or barley flour, which contain some gluten. I tend to let my stand mixer go for a bit longer kneading the dough to develop gluten (in any minimal capacity).

I have plans at some point to try isolating & concentrating rye/barley gluten and introducing that to the gluten free flour mix, like the process to make seitan (for an example of what I'm talking about, see <a href="https://youtu.be/zDEcvSc2UKA?t=88">here</a>). But that will have to wait for another day when I'm inspired for some kitchen mad science.
