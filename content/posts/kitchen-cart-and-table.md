## Piling Up Everything After a Ton of Planning
I went with walnut, as it is relatively cheap in Tennessee. But this was definitely the no-turning-back moment.

Showing up to the lumber yard in my sedan was probably hilarious to the owner, but the wood fit (I think these were 8ft S2S)
> S2S = <u>S</u>urfaced on <u>2</u> <u>S</u>ides. In reality this was S3S, as there was a straight cut ripped edge. All lumber from Lowes/Home Depot is going to be S4S.

## Table Frame
#### Pipe projects were all the rage at this point (Summer 2016), but I was going to put a bit more thought into my project.
In reality it was easy and I didn't have a good plan for making legs/frame in an apartment "woodworking" setup
{{< figure src="https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/_data/i/galleries/website-pics/2020/9-26-table/Picture2-xx.jpg" caption="Left: the design I went with. Right: the design I secretly wanted to do, but pipe fittings are expensive. Also give everyone the opportunity for proper after dinner leg crossing" >}}
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00305-la.JPG' alt='DSC00305.JPG'/>
This was surprisingly expensive. Probably Lowes/Home Depot's way of cashing in on the pipe crafting trend

<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00311-la.JPG' alt='DSC00311.JPG'/>
Here you can get a sense of the design I was going for. I took some time to improve on the designs I had seen as to maximize the distance between the bottom edge of the table and someone's thighs as well as making all 4 sides usable. This X-shape gives everyone room for knees and thighs. And yes I did a few simulations in Adobe Illustrator

<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00318-la.JPG' alt='DSC00318.JPG'/>
As well as being a necessary connector, these also gave me some wiggle room to level out the table. Since I didn't have a large planer to ensure that, I gave myself a few places where I could level things out.

Mockup of the final table dimensions to ensure I was in the right ballpark. Also I needed a work surface to cut the wood later.

I kept having to go back and ensure everything was parallel & screwed in the same. If they weren't, nothing would come together in later steps
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00332-la.JPG' alt='DSC00332.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00333-la.JPG' alt='DSC00333.JPG'/>
It might be obvious to some, but at first I designed an impossible structure. There was no way to get everything to screw together if not for the union couplings
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00334-la.JPG' alt='DSC00334.JPG'/>
The union couplings allowed me to build 2 identical top & bottom pieces of the frame and actually get it together. It did take me a few days to figure out these existed. Luckily I caught my impossible design in the planning stage and not after buying pipe

This was the main inspiration for this entire project: a way for me to hang my pans
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00342-la.JPG' alt='DSC00342.JPG'/>
I couldn't find any S-hooks that were designed the way I needed them to be, or be large enough to fit into the holes in my pan handles, so I got these and figured I would try bending them 90 degrees

<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00345-la.JPG' alt='DSC00345.JPG'/>
With 2 wrenches, this wasn't that difficult. I think they were even stainless steel

Here is a way I could adapt my casters to fit in the cavity of the pipe fittings while staying somewhat upright. I did have to replace the wood about a year or 2 later.

I was so happy at this point, but I was slightly dreading that I had finally come to the point where I had to cut the wood

## Cutting the Wood
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00356-la.JPG' alt='DSC00356.JPG'/>
Yeah, a circular saw is all I could manage on a tight budget. That blue jig in the top right would serve as the rip fence for the rip cuts a few pictures down. I'm sure I committed some woodworking crime but it worked. Also thankfully, I lived between 2 hard of hearing elderly neighbors (or they were very nice and lied that they couldn't hear anything)
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00357-la.JPG' alt='DSC00357.JPG'/>
I made some random chop cuts first so I had some experience with the saw before making the rip cuts, as well as making the rips a bit more manageable. Yes this was the first time I had ever used a powered saw let alone a circular saw. Circular saws still scare me to this day
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00358-la.JPG' alt='DSC00358.JPG'/>
Probably a lot of time passed between the previous picture and this one. I planned a bunch and psyched myself up to make the cuts.
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00359-la.JPG' alt='DSC00359.JPG'/>
I actually had the foresight to go with an edge-grain style butcher block style table. The main reason is that I knew the circular saw was not going to be very accurate with respect to the angle of the blade, which would make glue-up impossible if trying to glue 2 cuts together (which would be necessary in end-grain or face-grain cutting board aesthetics). By doing edge-grain, those inaccuracies wouldn't be glued to anything (here: facing up) and could be planed/sanded down.
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00360-la.JPG' alt='DSC00360.JPG'/>
After a lot of cutting to make the pieces random in length. I used the foam as a sacrificial cutting surface to minimize tear-out of the wood
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00361-la.JPG' alt='DSC00361.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00364-la.JPG' alt='DSC00364.JPG'/>
Here you can see the idea coming together a bit better
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00365-la.JPG' alt='DSC00365.JPG'/>
Well, this is what I get for using a circular saw. Inaccurate cuts means more time sanding the end grain and using wood filler
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00366-la.JPG' alt='DSC00366.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00367-la.JPG' alt='DSC00367.JPG'/>
Progress. I can work with these smaller gaps
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00368-la.JPG' alt='DSC00368.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00369-la.JPG' alt='DSC00369.JPG'/>
Failed clamping attempt. It's hammered-down knowledge to clamp from above and below a surface for symmetric clamping, but it was obvious here that I needed a flat surface to do my glue ups. I had to laugh as I had taken a lot of time planning what pieces looked best where. Oh well, laugh while you can

## Glue-Up

### Kitchen Cart Glue-Up
Doing the glue-up on the kitchen cart first so I had some practice on a smaller piece before doing the table glue-up

Flipping the pieces for the glue-up
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00372-la.JPG' alt='DSC00372.JPG'/>
Went very quickly and glued as fast as I could, but happy with the clamping at the end.
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00373-la.JPG' alt='DSC00373.JPG'/>
Removed the piece to make everything flush on the left edge, cleaned up as much excess glue as I could, and left it clamped overnight
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00374-la.JPG' alt='DSC00374.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00375-la.JPG' alt='DSC00375.JPG'/>
Eek
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00376-la.JPG' alt='DSC00376.JPG'/>
I stupidly took the time to make and apply wood filler, which was all going to come off after planing/sanding, so don't do that until after you've planed
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00377-la.JPG' alt='DSC00377.JPG'/>
Cut off the excess overhang. I probably should have trimmed the pieces individually most of the way so they would be more usable, but I managed to use all the off cuts for other cutting board projects later
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00379-la.JPG' alt='DSC00379.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00380-la.JPG' alt='DSC00380.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00381-la.JPG' alt='DSC00381.JPG'/>
Leaving this for now until I have my table glued up

### Table Glue-Up
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00378-la.JPG' alt='DSC00378.JPG'/>
Marking off how much more wood I needed to make my table 36" square
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00382-la.JPG' alt='DSC00382.JPG'/>
After a lot of rearranging, I ran out of excuses and went for the glue up
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00383-la.JPG' alt='DSC00383.JPG'/>
In retrospect, I should have done this glue-up in 2-4 separate sections. Gluing a 1ft width section at least until the glue was tacky would have given me a much better glue-up and a ton less stress. You can see the hammer I had to use to bang the pieces together to minimize gaps. Don't do what I did if you recreate this project

## Sanding, Wood Fill, Planing, and More Sanding
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00384-la.JPG' alt='DSC00384.JPG'/>
To make wood filler, you take sawdust from sanding and mix it with glue, then smear it into any gaps. Again, I did this first one too early in the process, but at least I had practice
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00385-la.JPG' alt='DSC00385.JPG'/>
Here you can really see the issues with using a circular saw for the rip cuts. This all needs to be sanded down. At this point, my parents pitied me knowing how much sanding this would take and bought me a hand-held planer. Thanks Mom and Dad!
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00386-la.JPG' alt='DSC00386.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00387-la.JPG' alt='DSC00387.JPG'/>
I started off timidly, but learned to love this little planer
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00388-la.JPG' alt='DSC00388.JPG'/>
Much better already

Resting in its final location, waiting for final sanding and attaching it to the frame

<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00394-la.JPG' alt='DSC00394.JPG'/>
Now is the actual time for wood filler
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00395-la.JPG' alt='DSC00395.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00396-la.JPG' alt='DSC00396.JPG'/>
After much sanding

## Finishing Steps
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00397-la.JPG' alt='DSC00397.JPG'/>
Not shown is where I flipped everything upside down and attached the frame to the underside of the wooden surface with some wood screws through the holes in the pipe flanges
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00399-la.JPG' alt='DSC00399.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00400-la.JPG' alt='DSC00400.JPG'/>
At the same time, I was also brewing and bottling the beer for a friend's wedding, so my apartment was a mess

### Mineral Oil Coat
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00403-la.JPG' alt='DSC00403.JPG'/>
I had to remember to take a picture; the first coat of mineral oil was magical. Walnut looks good regardless, but now it really shined
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00404-la.JPG' alt='DSC00404.JPG'/>
Now I know why I saved the best dark wood for the table
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00405-la.JPG' alt='DSC00405.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00406-la.JPG' alt='DSC00406.JPG'/>
<img src='https://piwigo.alexnackenoff.com/i.php?/galleries/wood_table/DSC00407-la.JPG' alt='DSC00407.JPG'/>
Here it is finished. I put of a few more coats of just mineral oil and finished it with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Howard-BBC012-Butcher-Conditioner-12-Ounce/dp/B001ESTA30/">butcher block conditioner</a> (beeswax and mineral oil)
